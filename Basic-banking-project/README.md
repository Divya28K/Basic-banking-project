🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Python Project! 🚀

💡 About the Project: This is a simple console-based banking application that simulates basic banking operations such as:

Checking account balance 💰

Depositing money 💸

Withdrawing money 🏦

The program uses basic control flow (if-else, loops), functions, and user input to provide an interactive banking experience.

Features:

Show Balance: Displays the current account balance.

Deposit: Allows the user to deposit money into their account with validation for positive amounts.

Withdraw: Enables withdrawals, with checks for sufficient funds and valid input.

Menu System: Easy-to-use menu for navigation between options.

💻 Technologies Used:

Python (core programming language)

Simple console input/output

Functions and loops for efficient code execution

Why I Created This Project:

This project was designed to practice fundamental programming concepts in Python, such as functions, loops, and conditionals. It’s a great way to learn how to handle user input and manage state (like balance) in an application.

🔜 Next Steps: I plan to expand this project by adding features like account creation, multiple user support, and even a graphical user interface (GUI) in the future.

💬 Feedback and Suggestions: I’d love to hear your thoughts and any suggestions you might have for improving this project!
